# TryingToKnowYouBetter

Now how could I meet people without meeting them in person (ofcourse I wouldn't meet them in person -_- )???

By Finding where they live!!


# Step 1:

Getting to know a whole bunch of people!

Hmm? Let's first try my home-town!

# Step 2:

Well...Now we need to find these EPIC numbers?????

![step2](step2.png)

At least they took the photos out now :)

A little pdf to txt and grep latter..TADA!

![step2.1](step2.1.png)

Now We have these EPIC people of Agra here in our list.

# Step 3:

With a little help of python let's automagically get this:

![step3](step3.png)

and finally this:

![step3.1](step3.1.png)


Alright people, calm down we just know a little bit about their age,sex,parent/spouse and yeah 
a little thing called their Polling Constituency and the Voting Poll Station.


# Step 4:

But where are these Constituencies??

Easy, just ask Google? No Let's ask the Election Commission itself!

![step4](step4.png)

Didn't like the Google Sattellite Map? They have the KML zips for you as well! :D

![step4.1](step4.1.png)

Open the zips and the kmls then in Google Earth and Voila! 

![step4.2](step4.2.png)


# Step 5:

Alright but what about individual polling stations? Well...

![step5](step5.png)

JSON gives up the coordinates as well...

![step5.1](step5.1.png)

# Step 6: 

Hmm...Now what did the Manual on Polling Station that I found on Google said:

![step6](step6.png)

Okay, So lets' see:

1. People go to the Polling stations (GPS's coordinates of which we have)
2. Polling Stations are set up to be in reach of People (No more than 2 Kms.)
3. People are lazy so they must be living in that 2 Kms. area (Plus they can only vote in their constituency)

# Which just leaves us with one thing. We can now add all these up and quite accurately predict who is living where in the city.

# Which is kinda terrifying and kinda Sad.


#  Code: Coming Soon...
